\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Andrew Goryachev, for his guidance, advice and support throughout my PhD time. His inspiration and bright ideas always motivated me to think differently, as all good scientists do. Under his supervision I have obtained not only new computational and analytical skills, but also an invaluable knowledge of how science works. Moreover, I greatly appreciate his help and proactivity in organization of all the formal stages of my PhD, especially during the admission period.

I would also like to thank our unexpendable collaborator, Dr. Davide Marenduzzo, without whom this project could not get to a happy end. A special thanks to Davide for saving my commitment to a life. Namely, for his ability to instantly find a bug in my code, which I have spent weeks on.

Additional thanks to Dr. Marcin Leda for his priceless knowledge of non-linear dynamics and statistical mechanics, which he was always happy to share with me. Great thanks to Dr. Alexander Morozov for his help with numerical methods and for his ever positive mood.

This PhD would not be completed without my mum, who has always supported me at every stage of my life, my beloved wife, who is my main motivator, and my children, who make my life happy. Additional warm-hearted thanks to all my Edinburgh friends, who are always nearby and ready to help. A final great thanks to the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh for the financial support.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Electrostatics plays a crucial role in the membrane biology. Negatively charged lipids (such as PS, PA and PIP$_2$) are subject to redistribution under the action of electrostatic forces during various signalling events. Membrane recruitment of multiple signalling proteins (such as MARCKS or Src kinase) is often maintained by positively charged polybasic domains (PD). Even though adsorption of these proteins to the cellular membrane has been extensively investigated, very little is known about how electrostatic interactions contribute to their membrane lateral dynamics. This thesis presents an investigation of the contribution of electrostatic interactions to the membrane lateral dynamics by means of novel computational tools. First, I developed a dynamic Monte-Carlo automaton that faithfully simulates lateral diffusion of the adsorbed positively charged PD of a peripheral membrane protein, as well as the dynamics of mono- (PS, PA) and polyvalent (PIP$_2$) anionic lipids within the bilayer. This model allowed to investigate the major characteristics of protein-membrane diffusion on the uniform membrane. In agreement with earlier results, the simulations revealed the following microscopic phenomena: 1) Electrostatic lipid demixing in the vicinity of the PD; 2) PD interacts with PIP$_2$ stronger than with monovalent lipids. On the spatially heterogeneous membrane the automaton predicted a directional drift of the PD, which was validated by a simple mean-field analytical model. The predicted phenomenon could potentially play a major role in membrane domain formation. To test this hypothesis and to investigate the membrane dynamics on larger scales I developed a continuous model, which was based on the results of the automaton simulations. The results of the continuous model and the Monte-Carlo simulations were shown to be in quantitative agreement. The continuous model allows one to simulate the electrostatic membrane dynamics on micrometer scales and can be used to describe various biologically important processes, such as endocytic cup initiation.
