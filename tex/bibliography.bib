	is important to specify Ras interactions with membrane-associated

	how palmitoylated Ras proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane.

  abstract = {We measured directly the binding of Lys3, Lys5, and Lys7 to vesicles
	containing acidic phospholipids. When the vesicles contain 33\% acidic
	lipids and the aqueous solution contains 100 mM monovalent salt,
	the standard Gibbs free energy for the binding of these peptides
	is 3, 5, and 7 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energies decrease
	as the mol\% of acidic lipids in the membrane decreases and/or as
	the salt concentration increases. Several lines of evidence suggest
	that these hydrophilic peptides do not penetrate the polar headgroup
	region of the membrane and that the binding is mainly due to electrostatic
	interactions. To calculate the binding energies from classical electrostatics,
	we applied the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation to atomic models
	of the phospholipid bilayers and the basic peptides in aqueous solution.
	The electrostatic free energy of interaction, which arises from both
	a long-range coulombic attraction between the positively charged
	peptide and the negatively charged lipid bilayer, and a short-range
	Born or image charge repulsion, is a minimum when approximately 2.5
	A (i.e., one layer of water) exists between the van der Waals surfaces
	of the peptide and the lipid bilayer. The calculated molar association
	constants, K, agree well with the measured values: K is typically
	about 10-fold smaller than the experimental value (i.e., a difference
	of about 1.5 kcal/mol in the free energy of binding). The predicted
	dependence of K (or the binding free energies) on the ionic strength
	of the solution, the mol\% of acidic lipids in the membrane, and
	the number of basic residues in the peptide agree very well with
	the experimental measurements. These calculations are relevant to
	the membrane binding of a number of important proteins that contain
	clusters of basic residues.},

	and changes in cell shape in response to extracellular stimuli. In
	platelets, it is synthesized from PI4P by PIP5K in response to stimulation
	of a G-protein-coupled receptor by an agonist, such as the thrombin.
	In the present study, we have addressed the pathway that induces
	PIP5K Iα activation following the addition of thrombin. Under resting
	condition expressed PIP5K Iα was predominantly localized in a perinuclear
	distribution. After stimulation of the thrombin receptor, PAR1, or
	overexpression of a constitutively active variant of Gαq, PIP5K Iα
	translocated to the plasma membrane. Movement of PIP5K Iα to the
	cell membrane was dependent on both GTP-bound Rac and Rho, but not
	Arf, because: 1) inactive GDP-bound variants of either Rac or Rho
	blocked the translocation induced by constitutively active Gαq, 2)
	constitutively GTP-bound active variants of Rac or Rho induced PIP5K
	Iα translocation in the absence of other stimuli, and 3) constitutively
	active variants of Arf1 or Arf6 failed to induce membrane translocation
	of PIP5K Iα. In addition, a dominant negative variant of Rho blocked
	the PIP5K Iα membrane translocation induced by constitutively active
	Rac, whereas dominant negative variants of either Rac or Arf6 failed
	to block PIP5K Iα membrane translocation induced by constitutively
	active Rho. This implies that the effect on PIP5K Iα by Rac is indirect,
	and requires the activation of Rho. In contrast to the findings with
	PIP5K Iα, the related lipid kinase PIP4K failed to undergo translocation
	after stimulation by small GTP-binding proteins Rac or Rho. We also
	tested whether membrane localization of PIP5K Iα correlated with
	an increase in its lipid kinase activity and found that co-expressing
	of PIP5K Iα with either constitutively active Gαq, Rac, or Rho led
	to a 5- to 7-fold increase in PIP5K Iα activity. Thus, these findings
	suggest that stimulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (PAR1) leads
	to the sequential activation of Gαq, Rac, Rho, and PIP5K Iα. Once
	activated and translocated to the cell membrane, PIP5K Iα becomes
	available to phosphorylate PI4P to generate PI4,5P2 on the plasma
	membrane.},

	3-kinase by catalyzing the removal of the 3' phosphate of phosphoinositides.
	Despite the critical role of PTEN in cell signaling and regulation,
	the mechanisms of its membrane recruitment and activation is still
	poorly understood. PTEN is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase
	domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail region that contains the
	PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain-binding sequence and multiple
	phosphorylation sites. Our in vitro surface plasmon resonance measurements
	using immobilized vesicles showed that both the phosphatase domain
	and the C2 domain, but not the C-terminal tail, are involved in electrostatic
	membrane binding of PTEN. Furthermore, the phosphorylation-mimicking
	mutation on the C-terminal tail of PTEN caused an approximately 80-fold
	reduction in its membrane affinity, mainly by slowing the membrane-association
	step. Subcellular localization studies of PTEN transfected into HEK293T
	and HeLa cells indicated that targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane
	is coupled with rapid degradation and that the phosphatase domain
	and the C2 domain are both necessary and sufficient for its membrane
	recruitment. Results also indicated that the phosphorylation regulates
	the targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane not by blocking the
	PDZ domain-binding site but by interfering with electrostatic membrane
	binding of PTEN. On the basis of these results, we propose a membrane-binding
	and activation mechanism for PTEN, in which the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
	of the C-terminal region serves as an electrostatic switch that controls
	the membrane translocation of the protein.},

	the decrease in the free energy of the system as the sum of two contributions:
	the free energy of mixing of neutral and acidic lipids and the electrostatic
	free energy. The first contribution is always positive and opposes
	domain formation, whereas the second contribution may become negative
	and, at low ionic strength, overcome the first contribution. Our
	model, based on Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory, makes four predictions:
	1) multivalent basic ligands, for which the membrane binding is a
	steep function of the mole fraction of acidic lipid, form domains
	enriched in acidic lipids; domains break up at high concentrations
	of either 2) basic ligand or 3) monovalent salt; and 4) if multivalent
	anionic lipids (e.g., PIP2) are present in trace concentrations in
	the membrane, they partition strongly into the domains. These predictions
	agree qualitatively with experimental data obtained with pentalysine

  abstract = {We studied the adsorption of a charged protein onto an oppositely
	charged membrane, composed of mobile phospholipids of differing valence,
	using a statistical-thermodynamical approach. A two-block model was
	employed, one block corresponding to the protein-affected region
	on the membrane, referred to as the adsorption domain, and the other
	to the unaffected remainder of the membrane. We calculated the protein-induced
	lipid rearrangement in the adsorption domain as arising from the
	interplay between the electrostatic interactions in the system and
	the mixing entropy of the lipids. Equating the electrochemical potentials
	of the lipids in the two blocks yields an expression for the relations
	among the various lipid fractions in the adsorption domain, indicating
	a sensitive dependence of lipid fraction on valence. This expression
	is a result of the two-block picture but does not depend on further
	details of the protein-membrane interaction. We subsequently calculated
	the lipid fractions themselves using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.
	We examined the dependence of lipid enrichment, i.e., the ratio between
	the lipid fractions inside and outside the adsorption domain, on
	various parameters such as ionic strength and lipid valence. Maximum
	enrichment was found for lipid valence in the range between -3 and
	-4 in physiological conditions. Our results are in qualitative agreement
	with recent experimental studies on the interactions between peptides
	having a domain of basic residues and membranes containing a small
	fraction of the polyvalent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
	(PIP2). This study provides theoretical support for the suggestion
	that proteins adsorbed onto membranes through a cluster of basic
	residues may sequester PIP2 and other polyvalent lipids.},

  abstract = {Reaction-diffusion equations are the cornerstone of modeling biochemical
	systems with spatial gradients, which are relevant to biological
	processes such as signal transduction. Implicit in the formulation
	of these equations is the assumption of Fick's law, which states
	that the local diffusive flux of species i is proportional to its
	concentration gradient; however, in the context of complex fluids
	such as cytoplasm and cell membranes, the use of Fick's law is based
	on empiricism, whereas evidence has been mounting that such media
	foster anomalous subdiffusion (with mean-squared displacement increasing
	less than linearly with time) over certain length scales. Particularly
	when modeling diffusion-controlled reactions and other systems where
	the spatial domain is considered semi-infinite, assuming Fickian
	diffusion might not be appropriate. In this article, two simple,
	conceptually extreme models of anomalous subdiffusion are used in
	the framework of Green's functions to demonstrate the solution of
	four reaction-diffusion problems that are well known in the biophysical
	context of signal transduction: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
	the Smolochowski limit for diffusion-controlled reactions in solution,
	the spatial range of a diffusing molecule with finite lifetime, and
	the collision coupling mechanism of diffusion-controlled reactions

	a fast diffusion coefficient (0.5 microm(2)/s) and short lifetime

	a combination of an experimental lipid bilayer model system and Monte
	Carlo computer simulations of a simple model of that system. The
	experimental system is a fluid bilayer composed of a binary mixture
	of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS), containing
	4\% of a pyrene-labeled anionic phospholipid. Addition of the C2
	protein motif (a structural domain found in proteins implicated in
	eukaryotic signal transduction and cellular trafficking processes)
	to the bilayer first increases and then decreases the excimer/monomer
	ratio of the pyrene fluorescence. We interpret this to mean that
	protein binding induces anionic lipid domain formation until the
	anionic lipid becomes saturated with protein. Monte Carlo simulations
	were performed on a lattice representing the lipid bilayer to which
	proteins were added. The important parameters are an unlike lipid-lipid

  abstract = {As charged macromolecules adsorb and diffuse on cell membranes in
	a large variety of cell signaling processes, they can attract or
	repel oppositely charged lipids. This results in lateral membrane
	rearrangement and affects the dynamics of protein function. To address
	such processes quantitatively we introduce a dynamic mean-field scheme
	that allows self-consistent calculations of the equilibrium state
	of membrane-protein complexes after such lateral reorganization of
	the membrane components, and serves to probe kinetic details of the
	process. Applicable to membranes with heterogeneous compositions
	containing several types of lipids, this comprehensive method accounts
	for mobile salt ions and charged macromolecules in three dimensions,
	as well as for lateral demixing of charged and net-neutral lipids
	in the membrane plane. In our model, the mobility of membrane components
	is governed by the diffusion-like Cahn-Hilliard equation, while the
	local electrochemical potential is based on nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann
	theory. We illustrate the method by applying it to the adsorption
	of the anionic polypeptide poly-Lysine on negatively charged lipid
	membranes composed of binary mixtures of neutral and monovalent lipids,
	or onto ternary mixtures of neutral, monovalent, and multivalent
	lipids. Consistent with previous calculations and experiments, our
	results show that at steady-state multivalent lipids (such as PIP(2)),
	but not monovalent lipid (such as phosphatidylserine), will segregate
	near the adsorbing macromolecules. To address the corresponding diffusion
	of the adsorbing protein in the membrane plane, we couple lipid mobility
	with the propagation of the adsorbing protein through a dynamic Monte
	Carlo scheme. We find that due to their higher mobility dictated
	by the electrochemical potential, multivalent lipids such as PIP(2)
	more quickly segregate near oppositely charged proteins than do monovalent
	lipids, even though their diffusion constants may be similar. The
	segregation, in turn, slows protein diffusion, as lipids introduce
	an effective drag on the motion of the adsorbate. In contrast, monovalent
	lipids such as phosphatidylserine only weakly segregate, and the
	diffusions of protein and lipid remain largely uncorrelated.},

	the mobility of Src FRET biosensors engineered to reside at different

	yields the familiar nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the

	charge density profiles are found when highly charged proteins adsorb
	on weakly charged membranes; the lipids, at a certain demixing entropy
	penalty, adjust their concentration in the vicinity of the adsorbed
	protein to achieve optimal charge matching. Lateral repulsive interactions
	between the adsorbed proteins affect the lipid modulation profile
	and, at high densities, result in substantial lowering of the binding

	interest are membranes in which the hydrocarbon lipid tails tend
	to segregate owing to nonideal chain mixing, but the (protein-free)
	lipid membrane is nevertheless stable due to the electrostatic repulsion
	between the charged lipid headgroups. The adsorption of charged,
	say basic, proteins onto a membrane containing anionic lipids induces
	local lipid demixing, whereby charged lipids migrate toward (or away
	from) the adsorption site, so as to minimize the electrostatic binding
	free energy. Apart from reducing lipid headgroup repulsion, this
	process creates a gradient in lipid composition around the adsorption
	zone, and hence a line energy whose magnitude depends on the protein's
	size and charge and the extent of lipid chain nonideality. Above
	a certain critical lipid nonideality, the line energy is large enough
	to induce domain formation, i.e., protein aggregation and, concomitantly,
	macroscopic lipid phase separation. We quantitatively analyze the
	thermodynamic stability of the dressed membrane based on nonlinear
	Poisson-Boltzmann theory, accounting for both the microscopic characteristics
	of the proteins and lipid composition modulations at and around the
	adsorption zone. Spinodal surfaces and critical points of the dressed

	surface. If additional charges reside on the side faces of the proteins,
	direct protein-protein repulsion diminishes considerably the propensity
	for domain formation. Generally, a highly charged flat face of a
	macroion appears most efficient in inducing large compositional gradients,
	hence a large and unfavorable line energy and consequently lateral

	description of the electrostatic partitioning of Src onto phospholipid

	peptide corresponding to residues 2-19 of Src [nonmyr-Src(2-19);
	GSSKSKPKDPSQRRRSLE-NH2] and a phospholipid bilayer, calculate the

	of acidic lipid in the vesicles is increased, the ionic strength
	of the solution is decreased, or the net positive charge of the peptide
	is increased. The theoretical model also correctly predicts the measured
	partitioning of the myristoylated peptide, myr-Src(2-19); for example,
	adding 33% acidic lipid to electrically neutral vesicles increases
	the partitioning of myr-Src(2-19) 100-fold. Phosphorylating either
	serine 12 (by protein kinase C) or serine 17 (by cAMP-dependent protein

	For each lipid, the C-D bond order parameters have been calculated

	order parameters were analyzed using a mean-torque potential model
	for the acyl chain segment distributions, and comparison was made
	with the conventional diamond lattice approach. Statistical mechanical

	the mean interfacial area per lipid. At fixed temperature, the area
	decreases with increasing acyl length, indicating increased van der
	Waals attraction for longer lipid chains. However, the main effect
	of increasing the acyl chain length is on the hydrocarbon thickness
	rather than on the area per lipid. Expansion coefficients of the

	At the same absolute temperature, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) series
	exhibits a universal chain packing profile that differs from that

  journal = {Science},
  year = {1972},
  volume = {175},

  number = {23},
  abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure
	of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is
	consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this
	model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous
	set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure,
	that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the
	membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely
	buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular
	molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The
	bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer,
	although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically
	with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore
	formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral
	proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent.
	Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different
	membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with,
	and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems
	appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions
	and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples,
	experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface
	changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects
	exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands.
	Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained
	electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding
	sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts
	(3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of
	normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig.
	7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing
	the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of
	antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The
	antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface
	immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C
	the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane.
	These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are
	replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments
	are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and
	related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce
	an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane
	of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules
	are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears
	to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some
	unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial
	importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen,
	as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

	S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26187–26193). We report here that adding
	10−100 nmMARCKS-(151−175) to a subphase containing either PLC-δ or
	-β inhibits hydrolysis of PIP2 in a monolayer and that this inhibition
	is due to the strong binding of the peptide to PIP2. Two direct binding
	measurements, based on centrifugation and fluorescence, show that
	≈10 nmPIP2, in the form of vesicles containing 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1%
	PIP2, binds 50% of MARCKS-(151−175). Both electrophoretic mobility
	measurements and competition experiments suggest that MARCKS-(151−175)
	forms an electroneutral complex with ≈4 PIP2. MARCKS-(151−175) binds
	equally well to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Local electrostatic interactions
	of PIP2 with MARCKS-(151−175) contribute to the binding energy because
	increasing the salt concentration from 100 to 500 mm decreases the
	binding 100-fold. We hypothesize that the effector domain of MARCKS
	can bind a significant fraction of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane,
	and release the bound PIP2 upon interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin
	or phosphorylation by protein kinase C.},

	experiments suggest the binding is driven mainly by nonspecific local
	electrostatic interactions. First, peptides with 13 basic residues,
	Lys-13 and Arg-13, bind to PIP(2)-containing vesicles with the same
	high affinity as the effector domain peptide. Second, removing basic
	residues from the effector domain peptide reduces the binding energy
	by an amount that correlates with the number of charges removed.
	Third, peptides corresponding to a basic region in GAP43 and MARCKS
	effector domain-like regions in other proteins (e.g. MacMARCKS, adducin,
	Drosophila A kinase anchor protein 200, and N-methyl-d-aspartate
	receptor) also bind with an energy that correlates with the number
	of basic residues. Kinetic measurements suggest the effector domain
	binds to several PIP(2). Theoretical calculations show the effector
	domain produces a local positive potential, even when bound to a
	bilayer with 33% monovalent acidic lipids, and should thus sequester
	PIP(2) laterally. This electrostatic sequestration was observed experimentally
	using a phospholipase C assay. Our results are consistent with the
	hypothesis that MARCKS could reversibly sequester much of the PIP(2)
	in the plasma membrane.},

  abstract = {The multivalent acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
	(PI(4,5)P2) plays a key role in many biological processes. Recent
	studies show that unstructured clusters of basic residues from a
	number of peripheral proteins can laterally sequester PI(4,5)P2 in
	membranes. Specifically, experiments suggest that the basic effector
	domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS),
	or a peptide corresponding to this domain, MARCKS(151-175), sequesters
	several PI(4,5)P2 and that this sequestration is due to nonspecific
	electrostatic interactions. Here, we use the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann
	method to test this hypothesis by calculating the electrostatic free
	energy of lateral sequestration of PI(4,5)P2 by membrane-adsorbed
	basic peptides: Lys-7, Lys-13, and FA-MARCKS(151-175), a peptide
	based on MARCKS(151-175). In agreement with experiments, we find
	that the electrostatic free energy becomes more favorable when: 1),
	Lys-13 and FA-MARCKS(151-175) sequester several PI(4,5)P2; 2), the
	linear charge density of the basic peptide increases; 3), the mol
	percent monovalent acidic lipid in the membrane decreases; and 4),
	the ionic strength of the solution decreases. In addition, the electrostatic
	sequestration free energy is in excess of the entropic penalty associated
	with localizing PI(4,5)P2. Our calculations, thus, provide a structural
	and quantitative description of the observed interaction of PI(4,5)P2
	with membrane-adsorbed basic sequences.},

	4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) in the plasmalemma of baby hamster kidney
	and Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts. First, nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled
	C6-phosphatidylcholine and C16-PIP(2) were incorporated into plasma
	membrane "lawns" ( approximately 20 x 30 microm) from these cells
	and into the outer monolayer of intact cells. Diffusion coefficients
	determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching were similar
	for the two lipids and were higher in lawns, approximately 0.3 microm(2)/s,
	than on the cell surface, approximately 0.1 microm(2)/s. For membrane
	lawns, the fractional recoveries (75-90%) were close to those expected
	from the fraction of total membrane bleached, and labeling by the
	probes was several times greater than for intact cells. Second, we
	analyzed cells expressing M1 muscarinic receptors and green fluorescent
	protein fused with PIP(2)-binding pleckstrin-homology domains, Tubby
	domains or diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding C1 domains. On-cell gigaseal
	patches were formed with pipette tips >5 microm in diameter. When
	the agonist carbachol (0.3 mM: ) was applied either within or outside
	of the pipette, lipid signals crossed the pipette barrier rapidly
	in both directions and membrane blebbing occurred on both membrane
	sides. Accurate simulations of lipid gradients required diffusion
	coefficients >1 microm(2)/s. Exogenous DAG also crossed the pipette
	barrier rapidly. In summary, we found no evidence for restricted
	diffusion of signaling lipids in these cells. The lower mobility
	and incorporation of phospholipid at the extracellular leaflet may
	reflect a more ordered and condensed extracellular monolayer, as
	expected from previous studies.},

	In this study, we present a live cell single molecule approach for
	quantifying the exchange kinetics of plasma membrane and cytosolic
	populations of fluorescently labeled Lck, the key Src family kinase
	involved in early T cell signaling. Total internal reflection (TIR)
	fluorescence microscopy was employed for confining the analysis to
	membrane-proximal molecules. Upon photobleaching Lck-YFP in TIR configuration,
	fluorescence recovery proceeds first via the cytosol outside of the
	evanescent field, so that in the early phase fluorescence signal
	arises predominantly from membrane-proximal cytosolic Lck. The diffusion
	constant of each molecule allowed us to distinguish whether the molecule
	has already associated with the plasma membrane or was still freely
	diffusing in the cytosol. From the number of molecules that inserted
	during the recovery time we quantified the insertion kinetics: on
	average, membrane-proximal molecules within the evanescent field
	needed approximately 400 ms to be inserted. The average lifetime
	of Lck in the plasma membrane was estimated at 50 s; together with
	the mobility of 0.26 microm(2)/s this provides sufficient time to
	explore the surface of the whole T cell before dissociation into
	the cytosol. Experiments on palmitoylation-deficient Lck mutants
	yielded similar on-rates, but substantially increased off-rates.
	We discuss our findings based on a model for the plasma membrane
	association and dissociation kinetics of Lck, which accounts for
	reversible palmitoylation on cysteine 3 and 5.},
